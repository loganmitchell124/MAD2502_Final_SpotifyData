User interface:
First, provide introduction to what the project is, who it's by, etc.

After introduction screen, go to main display menu, where user can select between two options
    1. Upload their own personal spotify data (JSON file)
    2. Explore trends from Billboard's 2000-2019 data

If user selects option 1, automatically generate graphs that shows their most popular artist by amount of time listened to or something.

If user selects option 2, they have 4 options:
    1. Take a look by year (what logan already did with the artist and genre by year)
    2. Show popularity over time of genres
    3. Explore their favorite artist (the idea is for them to input their own artist, see if its in the datafile, and look at their stats)
    4. Explore relationships between variables (the function min already did)
