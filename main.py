'''
First going to make a baseline for music popularity from 2000 to 2019. In this, we are specifically looking at 
    (1) most popular genre each year
    (2) most popular artist each year **logan is going to do this 4/15**
We should have a chart showing each year's most popular artist and genre. For this, we are going to use the popularity values already provided and see which artist/genre has the greatest value.
''' 



'''
Then, over the course of all 20 years, who is the most popular artist OVERALL and what is the most popular genre OVERALL?
'''



'''
For the most popular artist and genre OVERALL, what is the average
    - Danceability
    - Tempo
    - Duration of their music (for artist specifically)
